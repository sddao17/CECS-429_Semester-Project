Graduation is the third studio album from Chicago rapper Kanye West. The album was inspired by stadium tours, indie rock
and house-music and was a huge departure from the sound Ye had used on his first two studio albums The College Dropout
and Late Registration which featured samples and inspirations from soul and orchestral music.
