Conceived during Westâ€™s self-imposed exile following the 2009 VMA incident and further influenced by his deteriorating
relationship with model Amber Rose, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is a genre-bending masterpiece that explores the
darker sides of celebrity, fame, and love. Widely acclaimed by both fans and critics, it received a near impossible
10/10 rating from Pitchfork Media.
